			<h2>Why MSFT401k</h2>
			<p>You're probably already contributing money into your Microsoft 401k.  If you're like most people we talked to, you set up the contribution amount a long time ago and hardly look at it, if ever!  But you can do better in just 5 minutes a month.</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 80%;">P.S.  If you're not already contributing money to your 401k, you should strongly consider it to save for retirement and take advantage of the <a href="http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/benefits-and-perks.aspx">401k match benefit</a> offered by Microsoft.</p>
			<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
			<p>With some standard parameters<sup>*</sup>, the difference between annual returns of 5% and 6% is more than half a million dollars, which is an increase of over 25%!</p>
			<div>
				<img width="740" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; padding: 30px; border: 1px solid #BBBBBB;" src="assets/401kCompoundGrowth.png" alt="What a Difference 1% Makes" />
				<br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 80%;">* Parameters: starting today out of college, $100k salary, 6% contribution to 401k, and 3% yearly salary increase.</span>
			</div>
			<h3>Here's Where We Come In</h3>
			<p>We help you get the most out of your 401k.  We apply proven risk management strategies utilized by complex hedge fund managers worldwide to the investment options available in the Microsoft 401k Plan.  That means you get higher returns with less volatility.  Get ready for the caviar!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="main-section" id="section-how" style="margin-top: -20px;">
			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>You've probably heard about the difference between stocks and bonds, particularly that stocks are "riskier." Generally speaking, that is true, and that's a core part of how this works...</p>
			<p>We measure and track market risk and adjust allocations to get higher returns with less volatility.  When market risk is high, we put more money into bonds &mdash; to protect you against a stock market crash, like in 2008.  When market risk is low, we put more money into stocks &mdash; to maximize gains when the stock market is doing well.  The extra secret sauce: we tailor fit it to the investment options available under the Microsoft 401k plan.</p>
			<h3>What Do I Do</h3>
			<p>It's easy!  Every month, we'll send you our recommendation for allocations in your 401k to maximize performance and minimize risk along with detailed <a href="stepbystep">step-by-step instructions</a>.  But, you don't have to give us your login information or access to your hard-earned cash.  You log in and rebalance your 401k by yourself so you're always 100% in control.</p>

			<h2>Our Returns</h2>
			<p>Check out our returns against five other common investment strategies, both when the dot-com bubble burst in early 2000 and the crash of 2008.  Because we allocate funds dynamically to safer investments during periods of high volatility, we are able to protect against huge dips and have a smoother return.<sup>**</sup></p>

			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<p>We started MSFT401k.com because we couldnâ€™t find a decent way to invest our own money. We are setting out to build a product that we want first, and we think it will help our friends and coworkers.</p>
			<p>We believe in an alternate and better way of investing money in our 401k. We believe risk should be measured and controlled ensuring that we hold the optimal amount of stocks (volatile!) and bonds (stable) depending on market conditions.  And, of course, we use it ourselves.</p>
