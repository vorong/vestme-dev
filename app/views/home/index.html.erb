			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p id="foobar">You've probably heard about the difference between stocks and bonds, and in particular that stocks are "risker."  Well, generally speaking, that is true, and that's a core part of how this works...</p>
			<p>First, we measure and track market risk.  Then, when the market risk is high, we put more money into bonds -- this is to protect you against a stock market crash, like in 2008.  When market risk is low, we put more money into stocks -- this is so you maximize gains when the stock market is doing well.  And the extra secret sauce: we tailor fit it to the invesment options available under the Microsoft 401k plan.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="main-section" id="section-returns">
			<h2>Our Returns</h2>
			<p>Check out our returns against the S&amp;P 500 both when the dot-com bubble burst in early 2000 and the crash of 2008.  Because we allocate funds dynamically to safer investments during periods of high volatility, we are able to protect against the huge dips and have a smoother return.</p>

			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<p>We started MSFT401k.com because we couldnâ€™t find a decent way to invest our own money. We are setting out to build a product that we want first, and we think it will help friends and coworkers.</p>
			<p>Advisors push one type of investment strategy for 401ks: passive portfolios that require investors to select a level of risk as if more risk guarantees more reward.  But, it doesn't.  More risk means more risk -- remember 2008?</p>
			<p>We believe in an alternate and better way of investing money in our 401k. We believe risk should be measured and controlled ensuring that we hold the optimal amount of stocks (volatile!) and bonds (stable) depending on market conditions.</p>
			<p>Our algorithm is based on proven risk management strategies utilized by complex hedge fund managers worldwide. We believe in its ability to control the ups and downs of the market while also giving us a solid, steady return over the long run.  And, or course, we use it ourselves.</p>
