			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>
			You've probably heard about the difference between stocks and bonds, and in particular that stocks are "risker."  Well, generally speaking, that is true, and that's a core part of how this works...
			</p>
			<p>
			First, we measure and track market risk.  Then, when the market risk is high, we put more money into bonds -- this is to protect you against a stock market crash, like in 2008.  When market risk is low, we put more money into stocks -- this is so you maximize gains when the stock market is doing well.  And the extra secret sauce: we tailor this to the invesment options available under the Microsoft 401k plan.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="main-section" id="section-what">
			<h2>What Do I Do</h2>
			<p>
			It's so easy!  Every month, we'll send you our recommendation for asset allocations.  We'll tell you step-by-step how to log into your account and update your 401k account allocations to maximize performance and minimize risk.

			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<p>
			We started MSFT401k.com because we couldn’t find a decent way to invest our own money. We are
setting out to build a product that we want first, because we think it will help friends and coworkers.
</p><p>
Advisors resign to push only one type of investment strategy for money in 401ks. They push Modern
Portfolio Theory and their passive portfolios as the only solutions. These strategies require that
investors select a level of risk as if risk equals more reward. Under Modern Portfolio Theory investors
need to increase risk to increase returns eventually causing the strategy and investor to crack in major
market meltdowns (remember 2008?).
</p><p>
Online as well as paid advisors don’t offer guidance on 401k plans because there is no way for them
to monetize the management of money held in a 401k. As such there are limited strategies and help
provided to participants of 401ks.
</p><p>
We believe in an alternative and better way of investing our money in our 401k. We believe risk should
be measured and controlled ensuring that we hold the optimal amount of stocks (volatile!) and bonds
(stable) depending on the market conditions.
</p><p>
We developed an algorithm based on proven risk management strategies utilized by complex hedge
fund managers worldwide. We believe in its ability to control the ups and downs of the market while
also giving us a good return over the long run.
</p><p>
We will give monthly rebalance “blueprints” in the form of an email to all subscribers.
